		<p>
			Mobile and desktop player for the self-hosted Euterpe streaming
			server. You need an access to the Euterpe server running somewhere in
			order to use this program effectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that this is still an early stage for this application.
			It is absolutely good enough to be your day-to-day Euterpe player but
			it still has many improvements incoming.
		</p>
		<p>
			With that said, this is what the client supports now:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Extremely light resource usage and fast. Excellent for constrained
				mobile devices such as phones and laptops.
			</li>
			<li>
				Accessing Euterpe server with or without authentication.
			</li>
			<li>
				Playing albums or a single tracks.
			</li>
			<li>
				Searching the database for music.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mobile first but convergent. It works on both mobile and desktop Linux.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<releases>
		<release version="0.3.0" date="2021-12-11">
			<description>
				<p>
					This version is very near to being feature complete with
					the iOS and iPhone apps for Euterpe. And a lot less buggy.
					Which makes it absolutely usable day-to-day.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notable changes since v0.2.0.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The play queue is visible and interactive now!
					</li>
					<li>
						The window size and state is restored on startup.
					</li>
					<li>
						The recently added songs and albums are displayed on
						the home screen.
					</li>
					<li>
						Added the Ctrl+Q shortcut which quits the application.
					</li>
					<li>
						Many UI improvements. Some buttons are even colourful! I know,
						who though GTK could be so wild!
					</li>
				</ul>

		</release>
		<release version="0.2.0" date="2021-11-25">
			<description>
				<p>
					This version comes with a huge pile of improvements,
					bugfixes and new features. I will list the most notable.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Switched to libsoup from libcurl. This makes seeking and
						recovering from network changes rock solid.
					</li>
					<li>
						Added "artist" and "album" screens which list all albums
						for an artist or all tracks for an album. Accessible from
						the search results.
					</li>
					<li>
						The application state is stored on quitting and restored on
						staring. Including the progress of the currently playing
						track.
					</li>
					<li>
						Created an improved player controls widget with convergent
						support. On the desktop it is always visible in one half
						of the window. On mobile it is accessible on a full screen.
					</li>
				</ul>
