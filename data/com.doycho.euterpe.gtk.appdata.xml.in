			Mobile and desktop player for the self-hosted Euterpe streaming
			server. You need an access to the server running somewhere in order
			to use this program effectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that this is still an early stage for this application.
			It may be good enough for listening a song or an album. But at the
			same time big chunks of what is to come are still missing.
		</p>
		<p>
			With that said, this is what the client supports now:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Accessing Euterpe server with or without password.
			</li>
			<li>
				Playing albums or a single tracks.
			</li>
			<li>
				Searching the database for music.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mobile first but convergent. It works on both mobile Linux and desktop.
			</li>
		</ul>

			<description>
				<p>
					This version comes with a huge pile of improvements,
					bugfixes and new features. I will list the most notable.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Switched to libsoup from libcurl. This makes seeking and
						recovering from network changes rock solid.
					</li>
					<li>
						Added "artist" and "album" screens which list all albums
						for an artist or all tracks for an album. Accessible from
						the search results.
					</li>
					<li>
						The application state is stored on quitting and restored on
						staring. Including the progress of the currently playing
						track.
					</li>
					<li>
						Created an improved player controls widget with convergent
						support. On the desktop it is always visible in one half
						of the window. On mobile it is accessible on a full screen.
					</li>
				</ul>
